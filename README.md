# 📈 Linear Regression – Real Estate Price Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates the application of Linear Regression on a real estate dataset using Google Colab. The objective is to predict house prices based on various features and evaluate the model thoroughly.

---

## 📊 Dataset
- File: Real_estate (10).csv
- Target variable: Price
- Features include number of bedrooms, square footage, amenities, etc.

## 🧮 Model Used
**Linear Regression**

Equation:
y = β₀ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + ... + βₙxₙ

---

## ⚙️ Steps Followed
1. Dataset loading and exploration
2. Summary statistics generation
3. Train-test split (80/20)
4. Model training
5. Prediction generation
6. Model evaluation
7. Visualization
8. CSV export of predictions

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- R² Score

---

## 📊 Results
The model explains a significant portion of variance in house prices and performs well on unseen data.
